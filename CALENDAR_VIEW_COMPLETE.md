Hashtags and Ask AI buttons work normally
```

### 3. Historical Data Generation

```bash
npm run seed-historical-mock
```
- Generates 7 weeks of mock SF news data
- Completes in under 1 minute
- Perfect for development and testing
- Realistic structure, generic content

#### Real Data (Slow - for production)
