## 🎯 Feature Details

### Feature 1: AI Q&A for News

**User Experience**:
```
User clicks "Ask AI" button
  ↓
Modal opens with category-specific styling
  ↓
User asks: "What are the key developments?"
  ↓
AI analyzes news and responds with SF-specific insights
  ↓
User asks follow-up questions
  ↓
Conversation continues with full context
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Component**: Float-in-place modal (bottom-right)
- **API**: `/api/news-qa` using Novita AI (DeepSeek v3.2)
- **Context**: Summaries, bullets, keywords, top 5 sources
- **Memory**: Conversation history maintained during session
- **Styling**: Category-specific colors (blue/purple/green/orange)

**Example Questions Users Can Ask**:
- "What are the key developments this week?"
- "How does this impact SF residents?"
- "Can you explain [specific topic]?"
- "What should I watch for next?"

### Feature 2: Hashtag Navigation with Highlighting

**User Experience**:
```
User sees hashtag in news card header
  ↓
Clicks #Housing (or any keyword)
  ↓
Page smoothly scrolls to related category
  ↓
Target card highlights with colored ring (3 seconds)
  ↓
User continues reading in highlighted section
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Smart Routing**: Keywords mapped to categories using heuristics
- **Smooth Scroll**: CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` + `scrollIntoView`
- **Highlight**: Tailwind `ring-4` with category-specific colors
- **Auto-Fade**: Highlight removes after 3 seconds
- **IDs**: Each card has `id="news-{category}"` for targeting

**Keyword Mapping Examples**:
- `#Housing`, `#Market` → Economy card
- `#Election`, `#Government` → Politics card
- `#Tech`, `#Startup` → Tech card
- `#BART`, `#Community` → SF Local card
