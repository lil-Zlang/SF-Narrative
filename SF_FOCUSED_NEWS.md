## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. **NewsAPI Query Filtering**
```typescript
// lib/news-api.ts
const categoryQueries = {
  tech: {
    q: '("San Francisco" OR "Bay Area" OR "SF") AND (AI OR technology OR startup)',
    domains: 'techcrunch.com,sfchronicle.com,sfstandard.com,...',
  },
  politics: {
    q: '("San Francisco" OR "Bay Area" OR California) AND (politics OR mayor)',
    domains: 'sfchronicle.com,sfstandard.com,sfgate.com,...',
  },
  // ... all categories include SF terms
};
```

### 2. **Google RSS Feed Filtering**
```typescript
const categoryQueries = {
  tech: '("San Francisco" OR "Bay Area" OR SF) AND (technology OR AI)',
  politics: '("San Francisco" OR "Bay Area" OR California) AND (politics)',
  economy: '("San Francisco" OR "Bay Area" OR SF) AND (economy OR housing)',
  'sf-local': '"San Francisco" OR "Bay Area" OR SF OR BART',
};
```

### 3. **SF Relevance Filter**
```typescript
function isSFRelevant(article: NewsArticle): boolean {
  const sfKeywords = [
    'san francisco', 'sf ', 'bay area', 'silicon valley',
    'oakland', 'berkeley', 'bart', 'golden gate',
    'soma', 'mission district', 'california', 'ca ',
    'marin', 'peninsula', 'east bay', 'south bay',
    // ... 20+ SF-related keywords
  ];
  
  const searchText = `${article.title} ${article.snippet}`.toLowerCase();
  return sfKeywords.some(keyword => searchText.includes(keyword));
}

// Applied to all fetched articles
filteredArticles = filteredArticles.filter(article => isSFRelevant(article));
```

### 4. **Enhanced LLM Prompts**
```typescript
// All prompts now emphasize SF context
const prompt = `You are a San Francisco-focused news researcher...

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT: ALL articles MUST be about San Francisco, Bay Area, or Silicon Valley
- EXCLUDE national/international news unless it directly impacts San Francisco
- Every article must mention "San Francisco", "Bay Area", "SF", or related locations

Focus on:
- Stories specifically about San Francisco, Bay Area, or Silicon Valley
- Major reputable news sources (SF Chronicle, SF Standard, SF Gate, ...)
- High-impact, newsworthy stories affecting SF residents
- VERIFY that each story mentions San Francisco or Bay Area
```

### 5. **SF-Focused Summaries**
```typescript
// lib/llm.ts - AI summaries emphasize local impact
const prompt = `You are a skilled San Francisco news editor creating a 
weekly digest for SF residents...

IMPORTANT: All these articles are specifically about San Francisco, 
Bay Area, or Silicon Valley. Focus on the local impact and what 
matters to SF residents.

- Why do these stories matter to San Francisco residents specifically?
- How do these stories connect to SF's identity, culture, or ongoing issues?
- What should SF residents watch for going forward?
```

## üìä Example AI-Generated Summary (SF Economy)

```
"San Francisco faces a paradox this week as studies show housing costs 
have normalized while residents still struggle with affordability, with 
median home values skyrocketing 300% over 50 years. A violent stabbing 
incident left five injured downtown, highlighting ongoing public safety 
concerns amid major developments like Wharton's new SF campus and the 
Disrupt 2025 tech conference. Meanwhile, new affordable housing opens 
in Potrero and AI-driven cash buyers reshape East Bay real estate, 
reflecting the region's complex economic and social landscape."
```

**Notice**: Every sentence is about San Francisco or Bay Area specifically!

## üéØ SF Keywords in Use

The system filters for these location identifiers:
- `San Francisco` / `SF`
- `Bay Area` 
- `Silicon Valley`
- `Oakland` / `Berkeley`
- `BART`
- `Golden Gate`
- `Mission District` / `SoMa` / `Castro` / `Haight`
- `Financial District` / `Tenderloin` / `Presidio`
- `Marin` / `Peninsula` 
- `East Bay` / `South Bay`
- `California` / `CA`

---

## üìà Results

### Before SF-Filtering
```json
{
  "tech": 10,      // Mix of global + SF news
  "politics": 10,  // Mostly national news
  "economy": 10,   // Federal Reserve, national markets
  "sfLocal": 10    // Already SF-focused
}
```

### After SF-Filtering
```json
{
  "tech": 9,       // 100% SF/Bay Area tech news ‚úì
  "politics": 9,   // 100% California/SF politics ‚úì
  "economy": 9,    // 100% SF/Bay Area economy ‚úì
  "sfLocal": 10    // 100% SF local news ‚úì
}
```

**Note**: Slightly fewer articles because strict SF filtering removes non-relevant content. This is intentional and desired!
