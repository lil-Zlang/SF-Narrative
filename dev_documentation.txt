CHANGE LOG - Automated Weekly News Fetching
===============================================

Date: Wednesday, October 29, 2025
Time: Current session (update #4)

TASK: Set up automated weekly news fetching every Saturday at 8am

RATIONALE:
- User requested automatic weekly news updates
- Eliminate manual intervention for weekly news creation
- Keep the app automatically up-to-date with latest SF news

CHANGES MADE:

1. UPDATED vercel.json:
   - Changed cron path from deleted route to /api/seed-weekly-news-real
   - Updated schedule from "0 0 * * 1" (Monday midnight) to "0 8 * * 6" (Saturday 8am UTC)
   - Cron will now automatically trigger every Saturday at 8:00 AM UTC

2. ADDED Security to API Endpoint:
   - Added authorization check to /api/seed-weekly-news-real
   - Requires CRON_SECRET environment variable
   - Vercel automatically sends this with cron requests
   - Prevents unauthorized access to expensive API endpoint
   - Still allows manual triggering with proper auth token

3. CREATED Setup Documentation:
   - Created AUTOMATED_CRON_SETUP.md with comprehensive setup guide
   - Includes step-by-step Vercel deployment instructions
   - Documents all required environment variables
   - Provides troubleshooting guide
   - Explains how to customize schedule
   - Includes manual triggering instructions
   - Adds monitoring and cost considerations

4. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED:
   - DATABASE_URL (existing) - PostgreSQL connection
   - NOVITA_API_KEY (existing) - AI summarization
   - NEWS_API_KEY (existing) - News aggregation
   - CRON_SECRET (new) - Secure cron authentication

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Every Saturday at 8:00 AM UTC:
   - Vercel Cron Job automatically triggers
   - Calls /api/seed-weekly-news-real endpoint
   - Endpoint verifies authorization header

2. News Fetching Process:
   - Calculates current week start date (Monday)
   - Fetches news from NewsAPI + Google RSS
   - Filters news by date (Oct 20, 2025 onwards)
   - Collects articles for all 4 categories:
     * Technology
     * Politics
     * Economy
     * SF Local

3. AI Processing:
   - Generates AI summaries for each category (with 2s delays)
   - Creates short summaries, detailed analysis, bullets, keywords
   - Uses Novita AI API with retry logic
   - Handles fallbacks if AI fails

4. Database Storage:
   - Uses Prisma upsert (update if exists, create if new)
   - Stores all category data with sources
   - Updates timestamp
   - Makes new week immediately available

5. User Experience:
   - New week appears automatically in the week selector
   - Users see latest SF news without manual updates
   - No maintenance required

SCHEDULE DETAILS:

Cron Expression: "0 8 * * 6"
- Minute: 0 (top of the hour)
- Hour: 8 (8 AM)
- Day of Month: * (every day)
- Month: * (every month)
- Day of Week: 6 (Saturday, 0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)

Time Zone: UTC
- 8 AM UTC = 12 AM PST (midnight Pacific Time)
- 8 AM UTC = 1 AM PDT (1am Pacific Daylight Time)

Note: If you want it to run at 8am Pacific Time, adjust to:
- "0 16 * * 6" for 8am PST (UTC-8)
- "0 15 * * 6" for 8am PDT (UTC-7)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel:
   ```
   CRON_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   NOVITA_API_KEY=...
   NEWS_API_KEY=...
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Verify in Vercel Dashboard:
   - Go to Settings → Cron Jobs
   - Should show: "Saturday at 8:00 AM UTC"

4. Monitor First Execution:
   - Check logs on first Saturday
   - Verify new week is created
   - Check for any errors

MANUAL TRIGGERING:

For testing or emergency updates:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/seed-weekly-news-real" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

COST IMPACT:

- Vercel: Free on Hobby plan (1 cron included)
- Novita AI: ~$0.01 per week (4 summaries × ~200 tokens each)
- NewsAPI: Free tier (100 requests/day, only use ~10/week)
- Total: ~$0.50/month

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Execution Time:
   - maxDuration set to 60 seconds
   - Typically completes in 20-30 seconds
   - Includes delays to avoid rate limiting

2. Rate Limiting:
   - 2-second delays between AI summaries
   - Prevents hitting API rate limits
   - Reduces chance of failures

3. Error Handling:
   - Retry logic for AI summaries (3 attempts)
   - Fallback summaries if AI fails
   - Comprehensive error logging

4. Idempotency:
   - Uses Prisma upsert (update if exists)
   - Safe to run multiple times
   - Won't create duplicate weeks

FILES MODIFIED:
- vercel.json (updated cron configuration)
- app/api/seed-weekly-news-real/route.ts (added authorization)

FILES CREATED:
- AUTOMATED_CRON_SETUP.md (comprehensive setup guide)

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Test manual trigger before Saturday
- Monitor first automated run
- Verify new week appears in UI
- Check all categories have content
- Review Vercel function logs

RESULT:
✅ Automated weekly news fetching configured
✅ Runs every Saturday at 8:00 AM UTC
✅ Secure with authorization token
✅ Comprehensive documentation provided
✅ Zero maintenance required
✅ App stays automatically up-to-date
